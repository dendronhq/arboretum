This workflow covers:
- keeping a note on each person
- keeping track of messages

## Files
- [[notes/user.schema.yml]]: user schema file
- [[template.user]]: template used for given user

## Getting Started

1. To create a new user, open lookup and create a new person under the `user` hierarchy (eg. `user.john`)

When encountering a new person, add them to the `[[user]]` hierarchy
